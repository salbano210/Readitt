Readitt is an idea that I had while driving home one day from work and found myself resisting the urge to open reddit at a red light. Wouldn't it be great to have reddit threads read aloud to you as though you were just listening to a highly opinionated discussion? Wouldn't it be nice if there was a narrator keeping a bit of structure to the discussion? Wouldn't it be perfect if the application that did all this was named by a guy who thought reddit had two t's and not two d's?
