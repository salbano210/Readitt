# üó£Ô∏è Readitt ‚Äì Reddit Thread Reader with AI-Style Voices

**Readitt** is a voice-driven Python app that reads Reddit threads aloud like a conversation ‚Äî using different text-to-speech voices for each commenter. Great for turning long threads into podcast-style audio. I came up with it while driving home from work, wishing I had more highly opinionated podcast content for my ride. I also wished it could be named by a guy who sometimes thinks that Reddit has two t's instead of two d's.
